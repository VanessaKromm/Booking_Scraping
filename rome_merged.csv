Each room has different décor and colour schemes. They overlook the garden and all but one has a balcony.

The apartment is a Bed & Breakfast, located on the second floor of a building, thus it is not comparable to a hotel but to a private entity, equipped with a kitchen for private use of the owner where by law guests cannot cook or use the stove. There are three bedrooms for each couple of guests so those who book must know that they are not alone in the apartment but there will also be others since those who book are doing so in regard to a bedroom with bathroom and not the entire apartment.

Bed and Breakfast Zoe has excellent tram and bus links across the Tiber River to Rome’s historical centre. It is just 5 minutes’ walk from the beautiful church of Santa Maria in Trastevere.","€ 1,359"
